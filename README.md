Dummy Page for AI Chatbot Testing
At this stage, I have utilized Voiceflow to create the chatbot and have integrated it with a basic dummy web page. 
It is connected to the OpenAI API, Google API for geolocation, and Airtable for managing potential leads. 
For testing purposes, I employed a pre-existing model available at https://replit.com/@Jafielle/Test1ChatBotExample#functions.py. 
This model is currently supplied with documentation about solar panels.
